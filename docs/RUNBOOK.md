# Runbook for local development 

This project uses [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/), the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework
and [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).

## Development

This project requires at least:

* Java 17 + Maven
* NodeJS 18+
* Docker 20+
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

### Setup

#### With Homebrew

Use the [Brewfile](./Brewfile) for all necessary dependencies:

```sh
brew bundle && make bootstrap
```

#### Linux - without Homebrew

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

* [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)
    * [nss](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/nss.5.html) (if you use FireFox)
* [awscli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
* [terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

### Start local dev environment

There is a [Makefile](../Makefile) to ease the initial setup.

1. Make sure you have the very base setup if you run this the first time.
```shell
make dev
```
2. Start the backend
```shell
make backend
```
> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.
> The actual UI of Tapir is accessible via http://localhost:8080. Source can be found under `src/main/webui` 

3. Test using the example Terraform code in `example`. You need to upload a module with the identifiers that are 
specified within the code.  
```shell
make terraform
```

### Clean everything
This will ensure a clean state, where you need to run `bootstrap` again. 
```shell
make clean
```

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.
